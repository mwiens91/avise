## How it works!

Avise was created to help inform users of the effects substances have on
their health. This is achieved through

+ integrating bots on popular messaging services to conveniently track
  user data

+ providing real-time visualizations of users' consumption of
 potentially harmful substances

+ citing research tailored to the users' personal usage patterns

Avise provides a convenient and powerful platform for people who consume
substances to do so in an informed and responsible way.
